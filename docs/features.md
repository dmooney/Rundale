# Parish — Feature List

Parish is a text-based adventure game set in 1820s rural Ireland, powered by LLM-driven NPCs with a cognitive level-of-detail simulation. Every NPC lives an ongoing life — working, gossiping, attending festivals — whether or not the player is watching.

---

## Game World

### Setting
- **Location:** Rural Ireland (1820) — default mod is Rundale, set in the Kiltoom/Roscommon area
- **Historical context:** Post-Acts of Union (1800), pre-Catholic Emancipation (1829) and Great Famine (1845)
- **22 hand-authored locations** based on real Irish geography with lat/lon coordinates

### World Graph
- Graph-based location system with named connections between places
- BFS pathfinding for multi-hop travel
- Fuzzy name matching for movement commands (e.g. "go to the chapel" finds "St. John's Chapel")
- Traversal time varies by distance; in-game clock advances during travel
- Dynamic location descriptions using template interpolation (time, weather, season, NPCs present)

### Time System
- Continuous game clock: day/night cycle with 7 named periods (Midnight, Dawn, Morning, Midday, Afternoon, Dusk, Night)
- Four seasons (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter)
- **Five game speed presets:** Slow (80 min/day), Normal (40 min/day, default), Fast (20 min/day), Fastest (10 min/day), Ludicrous (100 sec/day for testing)
- Pause and resume simulation (`/pause`, `/resume`)
- Manual time advancement (`/wait <minutes>`, `/tick`)

### Weather System
- **Seven weather states:** Clear, PartlyCloudy, Overcast, LightRain, HeavyRain, Fog, Storm (`crates/parish-types/src/ids.rs`)
- Weather transition engine runs in the simulation tick path
- Weather state available to NPC dialogue context
- **Weather-gated travel** — connections carry optional `hazard` tags (`flood`, `lakeshore`, `exposed`) that make paths impassable in a storm, slower in heavy rain, or treacherous in fog. The flooded ford refuses the player back; an alternate route is used where one exists (`crates/parish-world/src/movement.rs`). `/weather` shows the current weather; `/weather <name>` forces a state for testing.

### Festivals
- Four traditional Irish calendar festivals, data-driven from mod files:
  - **Imbolc** (Feb 1) — Start of spring, feast of St. Brigid
  - **Bealtaine** (May 1) — Start of summer, bonfires lit on hilltops
  - **Lughnasa** (Aug 1) — Start of autumn, harvest festival
  - **Samhain** (Nov 1) — Start of winter, when the veil between worlds is thin
- Festivals display in the status bar and debug panel when active

### Travel Encounters (shelf-ready, not yet wired)
The encounter engine is implemented in `crates/parish-world/src/encounter.rs` with full unit-test coverage — ~20% base probability modulated by time of day, mod-driven flavour text in `encounters.json` keyed by time period. However, `move_player` in `crates/parish-core/src/game_session.rs` does **not** currently invoke `check_encounter`, so no encounter events fire at runtime. Wiring this into the movement path is a small follow-up.

## NPC System

### Cognitive Level-of-Detail (LOD)
Parish's core innovation: NPCs are simulated at different fidelity levels based on proximity to the player.

| Tier | Proximity | Method | Description |
|------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Tier 1** | Same location | Full LLM inference | Rich, contextual conversation with memory and personality |
| **Tier 2** | Nearby locations | Lighter LLM inference | Background activity, "overhear" mechanic |
| **Tier 3** | Distant | Batch inference | 8-10 NPCs per LLM call, daily updates |
| **Tier 4** | Far away | CPU-only rules engine | Probabilistic life events, no LLM required |

### NPC Entity Model
- **Identity:** Name, age, occupation, personality traits
- **Schedule:** Time-of-day-driven movement between locations (e.g. farmer goes to fields in morning, pub in evening), with optional home and workplace assignments
- **Short-term memory:** 20-entry ring buffer of recent interactions and observations
- **Tier assignment:** Dynamic promotion/demotion based on player proximity

### NPC Intelligence Profile
Every NPC has a 6-dimension intelligence profile (each rated 1–5) that shapes LLM prompt guidance and speech patterns:
- **Verbal** — Eloquence and vocabulary (high = precise word choice; low = simple phrasing)
- **Analytical** — Abstract reasoning (low = concrete thinking only)
- **Emotional** — Emotional perception (high = reads people like a book)
- **Practical** — Common sense and real-world skills
- **Wisdom** — Life experience and judgment
- **Creative** — Imagination and novel thinking

Profile dimensions are translated into behavioral directives and injected into the NPC's prompt.

### NPC Mood
- Real-time mood tracking with 20+ emoji states (anger, fear, joy, contemplation, etc.)
- Mood displayed alongside NPCs in the `/npcs` listing and debug panel
- Mood and relationships update from Tier 2 interactions

### Relationships
- **Seven relationship types:** Family, Friend, Neighbor, Rival, Enemy, Romantic, Professional
- **Strength scale:** -1.0 (hostile) to 1.0 (close), with configurable label thresholds
- Relationship history stored as an append-only event log with timestamps
- Strength visualized as bars in the debug panel

### Conversation
- Natural language conversation with any NPC at the player's location
- LLM-powered responses shaped by NPC personality, occupation, and context
- NPC token streaming — responses appear word-by-word in real time
- "Overhear" mechanic: nearby Tier 2 NPCs generate ambient background chatter

### Anachronism Detection
- Scans player input for words and concepts that post-date 1820
- Categories: Technology, Slang, Concepts, Materials, Measurements
- Word-boundary matching to minimize false positives
- Detected anachronisms are injected into the NPC's prompt so they respond in-period
- Both hardcoded dictionary and mod-driven `anachronisms.json`

### Improv Mode
- Toggleable "improv craft" mode for NPC dialogue (`/improv`)
- Enhances NPC responses with theatrical improvisation techniques

---

## Player Input

### Natural Language
- Free-form text input parsed by LLM into structured intents
- **Intent types:** Move, Talk, Look, Interact, Examine, Unknown
- Local keyword matching for common actions (no LLM round-trip needed for simple movement/look commands)
- LLM fallback for complex or ambiguous intents

### Slash Commands

Most configuration commands follow a **unified show/set pattern**: running the command with no argument shows the current value; running it with an argument sets it.

**Game Control:**

## LLM / Inference

### Provider Support
14 LLM backends supported out of the box:

| Provider | Type |
|----------|------|
| **Simulator** | Offline (default) — generates nonsense locally, no network or model download |
| **Ollama** | Local |
| **LM Studio** | Local |
| **vLLM** | Local |
| **OpenRouter** | Cloud |
| **OpenAI** | Cloud |
| **Google Gemini** | Cloud |
| **Groq** | Cloud |
| **xAI (Grok)** | Cloud |
| **Mistral** | Cloud |
| **DeepSeek** | Cloud |
| **Together AI** | Cloud |
| **NVIDIA NIM** | Cloud — OpenAI-compatible; ships with a Nemotron 3 Super 120B / Nemotron 3 Nano 30B / Nemotron Nano 9B preset triple via `/preset nvidia-nim` |
| **Custom** | User-provided OpenAI-compatible endpoint |

### Inference Categories
Four independent inference categories, each with its own provider/model/key override:
- **Dialogue** — NPC conversations with the player
- **Simulation** — World state updates and NPC behavior ticks
- **Intent** — Player input parsing and classification
- **Reaction** — NPC emote/mood reactions

Use dot-notation commands (e.g. `/provider.reaction openai`) or `PARISH_REACTION_*` env vars to route a specific category.

### Configuration Resolution
Provider config is resolved by `resolve_config` in `crates/parish-config/src/provider.rs`. Later layers override earlier ones:
1. Hardcoded defaults (default provider is **Simulator**; no network or API key required)
2. TOML config file (`parish.toml`) with per-category overrides
3. Environment variables (`PARISH_PROVIDER`, `PARISH_BASE_URL`, `PARISH_API_KEY`, `PARISH_MODEL`)
4. CLI flags (`--provider`, `--model`, `--api-key`, `--base-url`)

### Ollama Bootstrap
- Auto-starts `ollama serve` if not running; shuts down cleanly on exit
- Binary detection via PATH; auto-installs if missing
- **GPU detection** via `nvidia-smi`, `rocm-smi`, or `sysctl hw.memsize` (Apple Silicon unified memory)
- **Automatic model selection by VRAM** (`crates/parish-inference/src/setup.rs`):
  - ≥25 GB → `gemma4:31b` (dense)
  - ≥17 GB → `gemma4:26b` (MoE, 4B active)
  - ≥11 GB → `gemma4:e4b` (edge, 4.5B effective)
  - <11 GB → `gemma4:e2b` (edge, 2.3B effective)
- Auto-pulls models not already cached; warmup before gameplay begins

### Streaming
- Token-by-token streaming of NPC responses via an unbounded channel
- Streaming cursor in the chat panel
- Input auto-disabled during active streaming

### Inference Logging
- Ring buffer of recent LLM calls (configurable capacity, default 50)
- Logs prompt, response, model, timing, streaming flag, and error status
- Viewable in the Debug Panel's Inference tab

### Rate Limiting
- Outbound request throttling per provider client, gating every LLM call before it leaves the process (`crates/parish-inference/src/rate_limit.rs`)
- Token-bucket / GCRA quota via the `governor` crate — sustained `per_minute` rate plus a `burst` capacity
- Per-category overrides under `[engine.inference.rate_limits.*]` in `parish.toml` (`dialogue`, `simulation`, `intent`, `reaction`), resolved by `RateLimitConfig::for_category`; plus a `default` limit for the base client (`crates/parish-config/src/engine.rs`)
- Off by default — omitting the config (or setting `per_minute = 0`) leaves clients unthrottled, preserving existing behavior
- Both blocking (`acquire`) and non-blocking (`try_acquire`) entry points so callers can either queue or shed load
